## Lemmini

This is a fork of Lemmini by Volker Oth ([lemmini.de]: http://lemmini.de). It is released under the Apache License 2.0 and contains source code written by Martin Cameron and Jef Poskanzer.

Lemmini is the attempt to combine the playing sensation of the original Amiga version of Lemmings with the improved graphics of the Win95 port to create the best possible Lemmings experience on all platforms that support a Java virtual machine.

At the moment it only works on Mac OSX, and will only compile under Java 1.7. To compile to a jar just `cd` into the base directory and run `./make.sh jar`. It can also produce a simple wrapper for the jar and place it in the Applications folder: run `./make.sh install`.

This version expects to find the resource folder at `~/Library/Application Support/Lemmini` and the ini file inside. If you wish to migrate move the files before starting the app.
