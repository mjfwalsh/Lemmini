This is a fork of Lemmini by Volker Oth. It is released under the Apache License 2.0 and contains source code written by Martin Cameron and Jef Poskanzer.

Lemmini is the attempt to combine the playing sensation of the original Amiga version of Lemmings with the improved graphics of the Win95 port to create the best possible Lemmings experience on all platforms that support a Java virtual machine.

The Lemmini source code was released under the Apache License 2.0 as are any modifications I make to it.

At the moment it only works on Mac OSX. To compile to a jar just `cd` into the base directory and run `./make.sh`.
