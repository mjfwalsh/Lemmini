<h2>Lemmini</h2>

<p>This is the first time you start Lemmini, so please read the text below
carefully.</p>

<p>Lemmini is a platform independent engine for the game Lemmings. The original game
was developed by DMA Design back in 1990 and released by Psygnosis in 1991. All the
rights for the game "Lemmings" are now owned by Sony (as far as we know). Lemmini does
not include the resources necessary to actually play the game. You need a legal copy
of "Lemmings for Windows" to play Lemmini.</p>

<p>When starting Lemmini for the first time or when updating to a new version with
different resources you will be prompted to select your "WINLEMM" path and a
destination path that the resources will be extracted to. You don't actually need to
install Lemmings for Windows, it's enough if you enter the original CD-ROM.</p>

<p>While this is a bit of a hassle, this step is necessary to not infringe the rights
of the copyright holders.</o>

<p>Lemmini itself (the game engine) is free for all to use. Download it, give it to
your friends or whatever. If you intend to put it as download on your site, please
make a reference to the original homepage. Anyway, to respect the rights of the
original copyright holders, we explicitly forbid distributing Lemmini with any
"Lemmings for Windows" resources. If you still intend to do so, please contact the
copyright holders.</p>
